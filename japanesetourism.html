<u><h2> General Information </h2></u>
<div class="p1">
<p>Combining ancient culture with exquisite natural landscapes and dazzling modernity, the Asian nation is stirring an increasing number of travellers’ souls, and, over the last five years,Japan has seen tourism numbers grow by 20 million. In 2018 alone, Japan attracted 31.19 million international tourists.Why is this you may ask?
</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Tokyo (Japan’s Capital City) is home to one of America’s biggest entertainment exports, with a Disneyland theme park located just east of the capital at Urayasu, Chiba.
</li>
<li>Cherry blossom season is as popular with Japanese people and visitors alike, making the spring one of the most popular times to visit the country, along with autumn, when the leaves of Japan’s forests blaze red and gold
</li>
<li>Pod hotels,yes, the rooms are tiny, but a newer breed of pod hotels offers spa treatments, luxury toiletries and high-tech amenities such as air humidifiers and tablets.
</li>
<li>Japanese snow has been called the “lightest and fluffiest known to man”, so there is every reason the give Europe’s Alps a miss next season and visit Japan’s instead.
</li>
<li>Love hotel,these short-stay hotels designed for amorous couples, have proven increasingly popular in Japan, where space, and therefore privacy, are at a premium. Love hotels can usually be identified by the offer of two different room rates: a “rest”, as well as an overnight stay.
</li>
</ul>
